PISA can be hired to watch for on-chain events by requesting an appointment. At its core PISA is a watch and respond service, you can configure PISA to watch for EVM events and provide it with data to respond with if the event occurs.\n\nThe PISA contract is deployed on Ropsten at [0xA02C7260c0020343040A504Ef24252c120be60b9](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xA02C7260c0020343040A504Ef24252c120be60b9), you will need to include this address when encoding the appointment for signature.",

Metadata: \n  * Customer address - address of the customer \n  * Appointment id - unique id chosen by the customer \n  * Nonce - counter that can be incremented to replace an appointment \n  * Start block - the block when the appointment starts, only events observed between start and end block will be responded to \n  * End block - the block when the appointment ends \n  * Refund - the amount to be refunded to the customer if the PISA fails to respond \n  * Payment hash - proof that the customer has paid PISA \n2. Event data \n  * Event address - The address that emits the tiggering event \n  * Event ABI - A human readable ABI that specifies the structure of the event \n  * Event args - The ABI encoded arguments used to filter the event \n3. Response data \n  * Contract address - The address that pisa will respond to \n  * Data - the data to be submitted by PISA on response \n  * Gas limit - the gas to be supplied to the response \n  * Challenge period - the amount of time after the event that PISA has to respond \n  * Mode - used to specify pre and post conditions \n  * Pre condition - not currently supported, set to `0x` \n  * Post condition - not currently supported, set to `0x` \n4. Signature data \n  * Customer sig - a signature by the private key corresponding to the customer address over the supplied appointment data."
